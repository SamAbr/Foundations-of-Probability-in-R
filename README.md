# 🎲 Foundations of Probability in R

## Overview
The **Foundations of Probability in R** project introduces fundamental probability concepts through practical exercises in R programming. This project is part of the STA 1020A - Probability & Statistics I course.

## 📚 Key Features
- **Calculating Probabilities**: 📊 Determine the likelihood of selecting specific deals from sales data.
- **Sampling Methods**: 🎯 Explore differences between sampling with and without replacement.
- **Probability Distributions**: 🍽 Analyze restaurant group sizes to understand expected values and probabilities.
- **Uniform Distributions**: ⏳ Model wait times for data backups in a sales environment.
- **Simulations**: 💻 Simulate sales deals and calculate various outcome probabilities.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `knitr`

Install required packages using:
```R
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("knitr")
```

## 📂 Files Included
Here are the files included in this project:

- **📄 Foundations of Probability.Rmd**: The R Markdown file with code and explanations.
- **📑 Foundations-of-Probability.pdf**: A compiled PDF version of the report.
- **📊 amir_deals.csv**: Dataset used for simulations of deal selection probabilities.
- **🍽 restaurant_groups.csv**: Dataset for analyzing group seating probabilities in restaurants.
- **⏳ wait_times.csv**: Dataset for studying wait times and probability distributions.
- **📝 README.md**: The file you’re currently reading.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open **RStudio** or any R-compatible IDE.
3. Load the `.Rmd` file to run the exercises.
4. Follow the steps and comments within the script to explore the probability concepts.

## 📊 Datasets
The project makes use of several datasets to simulate real-world probability problems:
- `amir_deals.csv`: For calculating sales probabilities.
- `restaurant_groups.csv`: For understanding seating group probabilities.
- `wait_times.csv`: For modeling time-related probabilities in a business setting.

Ensure the datasets are in your working directory to run the exercises smoothly.
